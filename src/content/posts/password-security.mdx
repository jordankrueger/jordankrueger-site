Let me cut straight to it: **the single most impactful security upgrade your organization can make is adopting a password manager.**

Not two-factor authentication (though that's important too). Not a fancy firewall. Not a security audit. A password manager.

## The problem

Here's what I see at nearly every nonprofit I work with:

- Staff sharing passwords via Slack DMs or Google Docs
- The same password used across multiple services
- "Password123!" variations that feel secure but aren't
- No process for revoking access when someone leaves
- Post-it notes on monitors (yes, still)

Any one of these is a breach waiting to happen. Combined? It's a miracle more organizations haven't been compromised.

## Why 1Password specifically

I've used and evaluated basically every password manager on the market. For organizations — especially progressive nonprofits — 1Password is the clear winner:

- **Team vaults** let you share credentials securely (no more Slack DMs)
- **Travel Mode** protects sensitive data at borders
- **Watchtower** alerts you to compromised passwords
- **Admin controls** let you revoke access instantly when someone leaves
- **The UI is actually good** — this matters for adoption

## The onboarding process

This is where most organizations fail. They buy the licenses but never actually get everyone set up properly. Here's what a good onboarding looks like:

1. **Import existing passwords** from browsers and other managers
2. **Set up the browser extension** and mobile app
3. **Create shared vaults** organized by team or function
4. **Enable two-factor authentication** on the 1Password account itself
5. **Train the team** on daily workflow (generating passwords, sharing securely, emergency access)

I've done this for dozens of organizations now, and the pattern is always the same: 30 minutes of setup, followed by months of "I can't believe we didn't do this sooner."

## What about the cost?

1Password for Teams starts at $4/user/month. For most nonprofits, that's less than one staff lunch.

Compare that to the cost of a breach: legal fees, donor notification, reputation damage, lost productivity. The math isn't even close.

## Take action today

If your organization doesn't have a password manager, here's what to do right now:

1. Go to [1password.com](https://1password.com) and start a trial
2. Get yourself set up first
3. Then reach out to me at [passwordsetuphelp.com](https://passwordsetuphelp.com) if you want help getting your whole team onboarded
